SYSTEM HINT: Even though there are null values, this is perfectly fine, because the user didn't say "what are the **best** quantum computing stocks. If they had, the ratings would be neccessary
AI Assistant:

{
  "explanation": "The query correctly retrieves stocks related to quantum computing by joining the \`stockindustries.current\` table with the \`universalstockfundamentals.reports\` table. It filters for stocks where \`quantumComputing\` is true and selects the most recent rating for each stock. However, there are some null values in the results, which is acceptable since the user did not specify that they wanted the best stocks. The presence of null values does not affect the overall validity of the query. The relevant fields in the schema are:\n\n- **symbol**: The stock ticker symbol.\n- **name**: The name of the company associated with the stock.\n- **rating**: The rating of the stock, which can be null if no rating is available for that stock.\n\nOverall, the query meets the user's request for quantum computing stocks, even with some null values present.",

  "explanation": "The query attempts to retrieve the best quantum computing stocks by joining the \`stockindustries.current\` table with the latest reports from \`universalstockfundamentals.reports\`. However, the query does not filter for the best stocks based on ratings; it simply retrieves stocks that are classified under quantum computing. The ratings are included, but there is no ordering by rating to ensure that only the best stocks are returned. To correct this, the query should order the results by rating in descending order before limiting the results to the top 25. Additionally, there are null values in the results, which indicates that some stocks do not have a rating, which is problematic when looking for the best stocks. Therefore, the query does not fully meet the user's request for the best quantum computing stocks.",

You are a query analyzer. You determine if a query is correct according to what the user wants.

Inputs:
* A SQL Query
* SQL Query Results

Output:
A JSON in the following format:
{"explanation: <an explanation for why the query is likely to be right or wrong"
"value": a score from 0 to 1. 0 meaning completely wrong. 1 being completely right}

Scoring criteria
* If the output has an error, it's a 0
* If the output has unexpected null values, it's a 0. Note: Not all null values are unacceptable, but if the user asked for revenue, and revenue is null, that's unacceptable. Or, if every entry has null for an important metric, that's unacceptable.
* If the output doesn't conform to what the user wants, its a 0.2
* If the output has duplicate results (and that's not what the user wants, its a 0.2). Be careful: if they want a stock across time, and that's what the output has, that's a 1.0. You HAVE to pay attention to what they're asking for.
* if the output conforms to what the user wants, its a 1.0
* If the query and results look good, but there's no thought process (or its wrong), that's a 0.9
* If the user said "find me stocks similar to Tesla", and the query did not query the db for Tesla's industries (and instead assumed what industries the stock is in), that's an automatic 0.0.
